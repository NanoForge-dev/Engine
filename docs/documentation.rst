Documentation
=============

The documentation for the engine is seperated between the different libraries of the engine.
Then everything is packed up and put into this site. The documentation is handled on the engine repository and then automatically pushed.

This documentation is written in restructured text in order for it to be easier to operate with. We use sphinx to generate the relevant generated documentation.
